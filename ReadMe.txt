Program works perfectly to my expectations except for seralization. For some 
reason i cannot debug this issue. The onject is correctlt read out at program
closing and perperly read in at program start. However, all data within object 
is lost durring transfer. However, if files are added to the database without 
closing the file, the rogram works perfectly.
