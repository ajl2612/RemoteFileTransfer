This program is designed to add files to a database to provide quick and easy reference to important topics. This file provided an explanation to the functions of this program and how to use the program efficiently.

File

Open File - Selecting this option opens a pop up window containing a text region and a single button labeled search. Type the name of the file you wish to open and press the "search" button. Note that the file must be in the database in order to open it.

Save Changes - Opens a pop up window with with the label "Are you sure?" and three buttons "yes", "no" and "cancel". Pressing "yes" will write the text stored in the text region over the file from which that text was generated. Pressing "no" or "cancel" will exit the prompt without saving changes. The text will remain as is.

Close File - First prompts the user if they wish to save the contents of the text area. If they select "Yes", the data in the text field will overwrite the file from which the text was generated. The text field will then be cleared. Selecting "no" will clear the text field without saving the file. Selecting "cancel" will exit the command without saving the contents of the frame or clearing the field

Add File To Database - First opens a pop up file chooser, If the user presses the "cancel" button the command exits. If the user selects an invalid file or a file that is already in the database, an appropriate message is displayed in a pop up window and the command exits. If valid file is selected a second pop up window with three text regions and a button labeled "add". Insert a list of key topics covered in the file separated by spaces, the quarter the program was created in and the class the program was created for into the appropriate text fields.  Pressing "add" will then add the file to the database. If the user enters nothing into a text field or leaves the text "Enter X", that part of the file name will be defaulted to an empty string.

Remove File From Database - Opens a pop up window with a text field and a button labeled "remove". Type the file name of the file you wish to remove from the database and press the "remove" button. If the file does not exist in the database an error message is displayed in a pop up window. If the file can be located, it is removed from the database and a confirmation pop up window is displayed with a confirmation message. 

Quit - First prompts the user if they wish to save the changes made to the current document. After the user makes their choice, the program exits.

Search

By File Name - A pop up box is displayed containing a text field and a button labeled "search". After the user presses "search", the contents of the text field  are compared to every file name in the database. Files names which contain the data in the text field are displayed in a second pop up window in alphabetical order.

By Topic - the same search as above is implemented, instead comparing the data in the text feid to the list of keywords for each file in alphabetical order.

By Class Name - the same search as above is implemented, instead comparing the data in the text feid to the name of the class for each file in alphabetical order.

By Quarter - the same search as above is implemented, instead comparing the data in the text feids to the quarter each file was created in alphabetical order.

Favorites

After the user presses "add" the contents of the text field will be compared to every file name in the directory. Note that unless the name in the field exactly matches the file name it will not be added to the directory. A pop up window will appear confirming or denying whether the file was added to the database.

Remove Favorite - Displays a pop p window containing a text field and a button labeled "remove". After the user selects "remove", the contents of the text field are compared to the files already stored as favorites. If a matching file is found, it is removed form the favorites list. Note that the text in the field must match the file name exactly or else the file will not be removed. A pop up window will appear confirming or denying the removal of the file from the list.

Open Favorite - First prompts the user if they wish to save. If "yes" or "no" is selected the file is either saved or not saved and the operation continues. Selecting "Cancel" halts the operation leaving the text field unaltered. Next a pop up window opens containing a combo box and a button labeled "open". The combo box contains the file names of all the files currently listed as favorites. After the open button is pressed, the file selected in the combo box is opened.
