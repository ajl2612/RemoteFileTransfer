My name is Andrew Lyne. I am a freshman Software Engineer at RIT where I  
enjoy writing programs like these for school and for fun. Some of my 
other hobbies include skating, playing music and sailing. I've been coding 
for almost a two years now, the majority of which in java. In general I 
feel I am inexperienced for producing entire programs so I apologize for 
any bugs you may find in the program. However, if you find you like the 
program check in with me in a few months. In my free time over the next 
few months I will be streamlining this code and adding multi-language 
functionality. 

Have fun,
Andy
