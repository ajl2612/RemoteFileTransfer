        My GUI will be simple in order to maxamise efficency. The frame will be
set to a border layout with a JTextArea placed in the center. This is where the
file will be placed. The user can modify the file directly in the text area and
save any changes they make to it. At the top of the GUI will be a menu bar 
containing three tabs; file, search and favorites. The file tab will be where 
the user does most of the file manipulation in this program. Tabs in the menu
will allow the user to open a file, close a file, save changes to a file, add
and remove files from the database and close the program. The seccond tab 
labeled search will allow the user to search through the database for a file
either by the file name, topics covered in the file, or by simply listing all 
the files. The third tab labled favorites will allow the user to set shortcuts
to commonly accessed files. Users can also remove items from the favorites tab 
that they no longer use.
